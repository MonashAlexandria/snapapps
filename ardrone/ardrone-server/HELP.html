<h1>How to setup an AR-Drone server</h1>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
Connect to the drone's wireless network. Your computer will need to have wireless functionality.
This may take some doing. If you just cannot connect to the drone, try holding down the reset
button on the bottom for a few seconds before trying again.
<h2>Step 2</h2>
Extract the entire .ZIP archive to any directory
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<i>If you're using Windows:</i> Run "START.bat". Either double click it, or run it using command prompt.<br/>
<i>If you're using Mac:</i> Open a Terminal window, cd into the ardrone-server directory and run "sh START.sh".<br/>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
By this point a server should be running. 
If you want computers over the network to be able to control the drone, you may need to setup 
port-forwarding to allow other computers to access this one. Contact the network administrator if
you can't or don't know how to do this.<br/>
N.B: If you are using the version 1 AR-Drone, you will receive errors regarding the video stream:
<div style="font-family:monospace; width: 500px; padding: 8px;display: block; margin: 8px auto 8px auto; background-color: #AAAAAA">
TcpVideoStream error: connect ECONNREFUSED<br/>
Attempting to reconnect to TcpVideoStream...
</div>
Don't worry! This is normal for the version 1 drone, since the library where the server is from does not fully support the version 1.
<h2>Step 5</h2>
Use the special AR-Drone version of <i>"Snap!"</i> to program the drone! <br/>
To connect to the server:
<ol>
<li>Select the stage in the bottom right</li>
<li>Select the "Ardrone" block set in the top left</li>
<li>Drag in the "Connect to ardrone-webflight server with hostname []" block</li>
<li>Write the hostname in, or leave it as default if the server is running on the same computer.</li>
<li>Click the block just once to initiate the connection</li>
<li>Drag in the "Connection status" block</li>
<li>Click the "Connection status" block to test the connection. If it says "Connection Succeeded!", you're ready to use the other blocks!</li>
</ol>
